        <p align="justify">Thomas Jhon Watson Sr. was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
            Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and musical instruments before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which later became a widely known symbol of IBM.
            Mr. Watson was named chairman in September 1949. A month before his death on June 19, 1956, Mr. Watson handed over the reins of the company to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr. Another son, Arthur K. Watson, served as president of IBM World Trade Corp., the company's international operations.</p>
